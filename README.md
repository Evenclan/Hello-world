# Hello-world
Just saying hello

Board game lover and a traveller. Recently started to code a little bit and i liked it, so this is just my extended version of saying hello to you guys!

Oops, i lied.

I actually fell in love with coding and my plan is that i'm going to be a full-stack developer in 9 months as my bootcamp starts today (08.01.2019).

Really excited to be here! Lets see how it works out!
